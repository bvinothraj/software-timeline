# Software Integration Timeline

A visualization tool for displaying the evolution of software integration approaches from 1960 to present day. This tool generates timeline diagrams showing the progression from file-based integration to modern approaches like microservices and context protocols.

The timeline may not be accurate and there might be some variations with real-world events. Please feel free to [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md).
